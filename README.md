# VehicleVendorSettings
Change the scrap price for each vehicle, and if needed with permissions

## Permissions
*  ``vehiclevendorsettings.all`` - Gives permission to all of the permissions below
*  ``vehiclevendorsettings.minicopter``
*  ``vehiclevendorsettings.transportscraphelicopter``
* ``vehiclevendorsettings.rowboat``
* ``vehiclevendorsettings.rhib``
## Configuration

``` json
{
  "Minicopter Price": 750,
  "Scrap Helicopter Price": 1250,
  "Row Boat Price": 125,
  "RHIB Price": 300,
  "Requires Permissions": false
}
```

## Future Ideas

* UI that shows the real vehicle price
* Allow for horse prices to be configurable as well
